# EmployeesApp
The application lists employees along with little summary, fetching the data from an API call. 

## Build Tools & Versions used 
I created the project using XCode Version 12.2 and Project target is iOS 14.2 or later.

## Focus Area
I tried to focus a bit on everything in general. So my focus was on building the app the with good UX with a resonably good UI while also focussing on the architecture so that the app is more testable and extendable and also efficiently utilizing the networking bandwidths. But if I had to pick one, I would pick UI since I enjoy building UI a little more and spent extra time on the UI and implemented some basic animation.

## Copied-in code or copied-in dependencies
Few of the conditional statement in the guard statement in loading the image in imageview extension was referenced from StackOverflow.

## Tablet/phone focus
I built the app with keeping iPhones in mind but it should work perfectly fine in iPads too.

## Frameworks/Dependencies Used
No third party library is used
